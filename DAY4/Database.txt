Structured Query Language (SQL) i
the standard language for relational 
databases, used for defining, manipulating, and querying data.

Schema: The blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized, including tables, columns, 
data types, and relationships between data points. 

Database languages, commonly referred to as query languages, are a type of programming l
anguage that programmers use to define and access data. Within the database management 
system(DBMS), these languages enable users to perform tasks such as: 

Restricting data access
Defining and modifying data
Searching for information.  
organisations use specialised database software to avert such unfortunate events.
Step 1: Identify entities

E.g., Users, Orders, Products, Categories

Step 2: Identify relationships

E.g., User has many Orders → 1:N

Step 3: Identify attributes

User: id, name, email

Order: id, user_id, total_amount, status

Step 4: Assign primary & foreign keys

User: id PK

Order: user_id FK → User(id)

Step 5: Apply constraints

Email: UNIQUE, NOT NULL

Order amount: CHECK(amount > 0)

Step 6: Index hot paths

Search queries → index columns (email, status)

Step 7: Optimize for queries

Consider denormalization, caching, or partitions for high-traffic tables
